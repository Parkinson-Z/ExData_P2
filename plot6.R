#The dataset("summarySCC_PM25.rds") in the current directory has 6497651 rows and 6 variables. 
#The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database
#and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over
#the 10-year period 1999â€“2008.
#Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
#Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
#Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510")
#This plot is to compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor 
#vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater 
#changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
